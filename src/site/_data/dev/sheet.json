The ways of obtaining coins in-game, monster drops, salvage, and quests, don’t offer enough raw currency to counterbalance the number of coins being used. As a result, prices have been dropping for goods, particularly crafting materials such as ore, not necessarily because there isn’t enough coin to afford them, but because the value of the currency is so much higher than the value of goods, given their relative scarcity. A punishing overhead “tax” burden exists in the game, where the cost for crafting, home-ownership, or repairs exceeds the players’ ability to accumulate coin. In addition, companies are taxed for territory ownership, essentially disincentivizing PvP since the marginal costs far exceed any potential benefits.\n\nCurrency is so valuable now, that on certain servers, direct trades have become part and parcel of a make-shift barter economy, with neither party willing to part from coin. Trades such as 1000 linen, for 600 ore and 20 eggs, or star metal tools for 40 steel bars, are commonplace, like what one would expect to see in a hunter and gatherer society, which is surprisingly thematic, but nonetheless a frustrating experience for players.*\n\nhttps://blog.playerauctions.com/mmorpg/currency-crisis-in-new-world/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":271,"Date":"10/22/2021","Time":"15:26:11","Channel Name":"📖books","User":"daanneep","Link":"https://curamagazine.com/digital/pharmako-ai/","User Message":"here is a review https://curamagazine.com/digital/pharmako-ai/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":272,"Date":"10/22/2021","Time":"15:32:49","Channel Name":"🏢opportunities","User":"malte","Link":"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Join-Utopia-as-a-Design-Engineer--BUw6uptzTZYK9hChkbuRO6BPAg-1f2i81ypNeHXD4VIWw3Iz","User Message":"My company, Utopia (utopia.app) is hiring for ~~a~~ the hybrid designer/engineer .

For those of you who have seen Blade and Underworld and enjoyed the aesthetic, that was inspired by a roleplaying game that launched in 1991 called Vampire: the Masquerade. Instead of being a knight or a hero, you play a vampire who slowly becomes more monstrous (and progressively lose control of your character's free will).\n\nThat very subversive TTRPG launched the \"World of Darkness\" franchise, spawned the popular video game \"Bloodlines\", and has had a cult following, especially in the LARP communities, ever since.\n\nThe reason I bring it up here is because it's been exploring a \"gothic punk\" near future for a while. If Solarpunk was a Grade 9 science whiz, Gothic Punk is their older sibling who smokes cigarettes and wears a black trenchcoat to school. Has seen a couple of conspiracy movies on YouTube and is starting to see that things are drearier than the suburbs let on.\n\nThat whole community is interesting to explore.

In Norway, the most progressive electric vehicle policies in the world started with a pop group, an environmentalist, and a small red Fiat Panda. It was 1988 when activist Frederic Hauge, along with fellow green campaigners from the band A-ha, traveled to the Swiss city of Bern, where they found the red Fiat. A previous owner had converted the car to run off a lead battery, and the group planned to use the vehicle to persuade the Norwegian government to encourage electric vehicle uptake. \n\nEventually, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the incentives the group campaigned for started to materialize, handing EVs a superior status on Norway’s roads.\n\n[...]\n\nIn an attempt to claw back lost income, officials are stripping electric cars of special status, sparking fierce debate and concern that the country could jeopardize its goal of selling no new cars with combustion engines by 2025.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/norway-electric-vehicle-tax/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":648,"Date":"11/19/2021","Time":"10:19:43","Channel Name":"🚦signals-and-inspirations","User":"robbie","Link":"https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/","User Message":"https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":649,"Date":"11/19/2021","Time":"14:45:19","Channel Name":"🎬videos","User":"WrexVerdi","Link":"https://twitter.com/Vlambeer,","User Message":"Rami Ismail, giving his 10 blank slide presentation.

Pure research being the term for experimenting for experimenting's sake. \n\n\"Pure research (I could not remember the proper term, thank you) is vital to discovery, as you don't know what you are going to find! The other part of the Bell Labs model was that getting all these smart people in one place, and getting them to talk to each other in the cafe, or at the chess boards or just walking around would lead to cross pollination of ideas, which would lead to discoveries being made. This all is VITAL stuff for scientific advancement, and it's just not being done.  The US is spending about 3% of the GDP on this, and we should look at doubling it over the next 5 years and locking it there at minimum. (Chart: https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm)\"\n\nI'm all for moon-shot programs around energy, transportation, etc. At the same time, I want some good old fashioned scientific (mathematical, engineering, architectural, pharmacological)  screwing around to help spawn new ideas that build off of the results of it.

Managed retreat is “the purposeful, coordinated movement of people and assets out of harm’s way,” according to assistant public policy professor A. R.

But that figure, found in scientific studies, advocacy reports, the popular press, and even the 2021 U.N. climate assessment, is incorrect, obscuring the true toll of global warming on the north, a team of climate scientists reports this week. In fact, the researchers say, the Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average.\n> ...\n> Researchers have long known the world warms faster in the far north, because of a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. The drivers of amplification include increased solar heating, as dark ocean water replaces reflective sea ice, along with occasional intrusions of tropical heat, carried to the Arctic by “atmospheric rivers,” narrow parades of dense clouds that drag water vapor northward.\n> ...","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":952,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"16:53:52","Channel Name":"🔋collapse-tech-solarpunk","User":"zazou","Link":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/09/climate-crisis-kim-stanley-robinson","User Message":"A friend of mine interviewed Kim Stanley Robinson about solutions to Climate Change, published in the Guardian earlier this week:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/09/climate-crisis-kim-stanley-robinson\n\n**How Will Humanity Endure the Climate Crisis - Kim Stanley Robinson's Perspective**\n\n> To really grasp the present, we need to imagine the future – then look back from it to better see the now. The angry climate kids do this naturally. The rest of us need to read good science fiction. A great place to start is Kim Stanley Robinson.\n> ...\n> I spoke to Robinson recently for an episode of the podcast The Dig. He told me that he wants leftists to set aside their differences, and put a “time stamp on [their] political view” that recognizes how urgent things are. Looking back from 2050 leaves little room for abstract idealism. Progressives need to form “a united front,” he told me. “It’s an all-hands-on-deck situation; species are going extinct and biomes are dying. The catastrophes are here and now, so we need to make political coalitions.”\n> ...\n> More broadly, Robinson seems to be urging all of us to treat every possible technological intervention – from expanding nuclear energy, to pumping meltwater out from under glaciers, to dumping iron filings in the ocean – from a strictly scientific perspective: reject dogma, evaluate the evidence, ignore the profit motive.","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":953,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"17:05:57","Channel Name":"💸-filthy-lucre","User":"Jaymo","Link":"https://rhizome.org/editorial/2018/jun/14/island-mentality/","User Message":"Did a workshop back in 2018 called 'What will it be like when we buy a island (on the blockchain) https://rhizome.org/editorial/2018/jun/14/island-mentality/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":954,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"17:29:24","Channel Name":"🧰machine-learning-ai","User":"zazou","Link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04324","User Message":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04324\n\n**Deep Learning and Mathematical Intuition: A Review of (Davies et al. 2021)**\nErnest Davis\n\n> A recent paper by Davies et al (2021) describes how deep learning (DL) technology was used to find plausible hypotheses that have led to two original mathematical results: one in knot theory, one in representation theory. I argue here that the significance and novelty of this application of DL technology to mathematics is significantly overstated in the paper under review and has been wildly overstated in some of the accounts in the popular science press. In the knot theory result, the role of DL was small, and a conventional statistical analysis would probably have sufficed. In the representation theory result, the role of DL is much larger; however, it is not very different in kind from what has been done in experimental mathematics for decades. Moreover, it is not clear whether the distinctive features of DL that make it useful here will apply across a wide range of mathematical problems. Finally, I argue that the DL here \"guides human intuition\" is unhelpful and misleading; what the DL does primarily does is to mark many possible conjectures as false and a few others as possibly worthy of study. \n> \n> Certainly the representation theory result represents an original and interesting application of DL to mathematical research, but its larger significance is uncertain.","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":955,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"17:30:13","Channel Name":"🧰machine-learning-ai","User":"zazou","Link":"https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/nesy/","User Message":"https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/nesy/\n\nA new subfield in AI, connecting two largely disparate silos (Knowledge Representation and Machine Learning)","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":956,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"17:39:38","Channel Name":"🚀retro-futures","User":"camillemakes","Link":"https://archive.org/details/HyperCardVol1","User Message":"Speaking of monitors this emulator …: https://archive.org/details/HyperCardVol1","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":957,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"18:12:18","Channel Name":"🛠hardware","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy","User Message":"Anyone have any experience with this audio/DSP gizmo?\n\nhttps://www.electro-smith.com/daisy","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":958,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"18:14:10","Channel Name":"🛠hardware","User":"pegaunisusicornslimebreaker","Link":"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00GZC3CHK","User Message":"reminds me of this: Korg littleBits Synth Kit https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00GZC3CHK","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":959,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"18:19:54","Channel Name":"📚we-are-learning","User":"WrexVerdi","Link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshGambrell","User Message":"Started in on Blender, and am working very slowly on the \"Complete Beginner's guide\" tutorial at night: https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshGambrell","Link Type":"Social Media"},{"row_id":960,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"18:44:04","Channel Name":"🛠hardware","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://www.fm3buddhamachine.com/","User Message":"https://www.fm3buddhamachine.com/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":961,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"19:46:50","Channel Name":"🌐web3","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0sc-mpqj4qE9XG61uH1sGi5KBUeICxwGcz","User Message":"Gonna “go” to this next week\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0sc-mpqj4qE9XG61uH1sGi5KBUeICxwGcz","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":962,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"19:56:27","Channel Name":"📣introduce-yourself","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://calendly.com/julian-bleecker/coffee-chat","User Message":"Let’s DO this..\n\nhttps://calendly.com/julian-bleecker/coffee-chat","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":963,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"20:34:53","Channel Name":"📃articles-and-essays","User":"rena","Link":"https://hyperallergic.com/695572/could-3d-scanning-further-complicate-art-repatriation/","User Message":"objects, scanning data, ownership, appropriation https://hyperallergic.com/695572/could-3d-scanning-further-complicate-art-repatriation/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":964,"Date":"12/15/2021","Time":"20:51:26","Channel Name":"🚦signals-and-inspirations","User":"WrexVerdi","Link":"https://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!MTY3NTczNzQ.MjU4OTU5Nw*Mjk2NjIwODA(NzgzMDA0OQ~!CONTIGUOUS_US*MTAwMjQwNzU.MjUwMjM1MTc(MTc1)Mg~!IN*NTI2NDA1MQ.Nzg2MzQyMQ)MQ~!CN*OTkyMTY5Nw.NzMxNDcwNQ(MjI1)MA","User Message":"https://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!MTY3NTczNzQ.MjU4OTU5Nw*Mjk2NjIwODA(NzgzMDA0OQ~!CONTIGUOUS_US*MTAwMjQwNzU.MjUwMjM1MTc(MTc1)Mg~!IN*NTI2NDA1MQ.Nzg2MzQyMQ)MQ~!CN*OTkyMTY5Nw.NzMxNDcwNQ(MjI1)MA Having your country/landmass look bigger on a map sets the mental space of it.

Raises a number of questions about where we are as a society, at least in Canada. Our culture here is very monolithic and not open to dialogue about things like this.\n\nBased on this paper using Ontario's data for COVID, and based on Public Health Ontario's own data, here's how things stack up vaccination-wise.\n\n# of COVID cases, 0-19 --> 115,397 (PubHealthON)\n# of COVID deaths, 0-19 --> 7 (PubHealthON)\n--> Chance of a child dying of COVID: 0.00606%\n\n# of double-dosed male children, 12-17 --> 338,234\n# of myocarditis cases SO FAR in male children 12-17 --> 31\n--> Chance of getting myocarditis from two doses: 0.009165% (14 ICU admissions, 0 deaths so far)\n\n0.009165 > 0.00606, therefore the risks seem to outweigh the benefits for male children using Ontario's own data. Not a perfect apples-to-apples but this seems waaayyyy too close for comfort.

Later on he just names the action, but not the mouse/key combo, or says \"Go into Materials\", but for me I hadn't gotten the combo/symbols down yet. It lead to a lot of pausing and rewinding for me. \n\nHe'll also from time to time tell you to do something, that then won't work/give the result I was expecting, so I had that \"What did I do wrong?\" moment several times.\n\nThose caveats aside, it seems to be solid, and knowing how he teaches should make following future tutorials easier. \n\nIt's a 40 minute tutorial, which took me a few nights as I have been wrapping up projects at work and wrestling with some stuff at home as well.

However, the global diversity of plastic-degrading enzymes remains poorly understood. Taking advantage of global environmental DNA sampling projects, here we constructed hidden Markov models from experimentally verified enzymes and mined ocean and soil metagenomes to assess the global potential of microorganisms to degrade plastics. By controlling for false positives using gut microbiome data, we compiled a catalogue of over 30,000 nonredundant enzyme homologues with the potential to degrade 10 different plastic types. While differences between the ocean and soil microbiomes likely reflect the base compositions of these environments, we find that ocean enzyme abundance increases with depth as a response to plastic pollution and not merely taxonomic composition. By obtaining further pollution measurements, we observed that the abundance of the uncovered enzymes in both ocean and soil habitats significantly correlates with marine and country-specific plastic pollution trends. Our study thus uncovers the earth microbiome's potential to degrade plastics, providing evidence of a measurable effect of plastic pollution on the global microbial ecology as well as a useful resource for further applied research.","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1125,"Date":"12/27/2021","Time":"13:50:55","Channel Name":"🔋collapse-tech-solarpunk","User":"avicenna","Link":"https://www.sustainabledevelopmentindex.org/","User Message":"https://www.sustainabledevelopmentindex.org/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1126,"Date":"12/27/2021","Time":"15:51:44","Channel Name":"💸-filthy-lucre","User":"moo(eva)","Link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B8Fg2kZrxA","User Message":"The work with Whale language and ml at Project Ceti is also interesting, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B8Fg2kZrxA  🐋","Link Type":"Social Media"},{"row_id":1127,"Date":"12/27/2021","Time":"18:00:02","Channel Name":"🛠hardware","User":"GianPabloVillamil","Link":"https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1472988540933914631?s=21","User Message":"Blockchain connected “smart” faucets that play ads and calculate your “dwell time”: https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1472988540933914631?s=21","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1128,"Date":"12/27/2021","Time":"19:10:45","Channel Name":"🍿films-and-shorts","User":"camillemakes","Link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#End_of_the_pandemic","User Message":"<@256435411189104640> Fair - predictions abound and stuff like this is asynchronous.

It's a small point but one I think is worth emphasizing. There's a genre of speculation that is very much prose based and does a great job. But when the word 'design' gets tossed in the mix, I find it useful to reserve that for constructing something in a different form. To tell a story through objects rather than through prose. An important distinction that sets aside material-making practices from writing practices cf — https://buttondown.email/designfiction/archive/design-fiction-or-science-fiction/\nNothing against science-fiction whatsoever.

So, like..that was an additional motivation to learn how to build an ERC20 by hand (which I was curious to do anyway..but that situation was a kick in the rear to do so.) I don't necessarily think that it's wrong that they indirectly charge for their service, but either I didn't look closely at the T&C or something but that felt somewhat off the general spirit of things, particularly the ownership angle.\n\nPlus (I just checked) the contract source code hasn't been verified so it doesn't appear on Polygonscan, which is a bummer.

These technofutures regurgitate essentially the same office or kitchen as in decades past, and the same kinds of users and workers to inhabit them.\n\nSuch recycled futures masquerade as innovation to suck the life out of other possibilities. Space colonies and voice-controlled kitchens take on an air of inevitability despite their many postponements and disappointments, while critical refusal of these futures, or truly alternative visions, are cast as implausible. It is telling that our dominant technofutures have traditionally focused on two sites — the office and the kitchen — for this process of social conservation. Combined, they present a distinctly mid-century suburban ideal: masculinized labor and femininized (unpaid) labor; the full-time company employee and the nuclear home.

The practice requires driving at a plodding pace to conserve energy, around 40 to 50 mph on a gas-powered vehicle. The efficiency sweet spot on an electric car can be agonizingly slow—sometimes below 30 mph.\n\nRoad rage from other travelers comes with the territory, as Mr. McGrath saw when he and fellow hypermiler Kevin Booker set a Guinness World Record in July for lowest energy consumption traveling the length of Great Britain. They were able to squeeze 6.45 miles per kilowatt-hour from a Mach-E on their 27-hour, 840-mile trek, driving at an average 40 mph.\n\n“We had some honks and angry people behind us,” said Mr. McGrath, an engineer for an automotive testing and certification company who lives in Swindon, England.\n\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/ev-electric-car-battery-charge-hypermiler-11642517385","Link Type":"Book"},{"row_id":1467,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"12:36:15","Channel Name":"🎧podcasts","User":"polysemic","Link":"https://2269.co/podcast/no-expectations-only-hopes-guest-chris-daniel-travels-to-the-greatest-party-of-all-time/","User Message":"I'm a big fan of the whole 2269 project. They're planning \"the greatest party of all time\" on 6th June 2269, starting at noon.... and they're already selling tickets (in the form of beautifully made posters). Their tagline is \"put it up, keep it up, pass it on\".\n\nIt's a fun idea with a serious purpose. An enjoyable mechanism for thinking about our world not just in 2269 but also the people we will know who live through the 247 years between now and then. As such, I reckoned it might be of interest to people here. 🙂\n\nAt the end of last year it was my turn to take a trip in Michael Ogden's time machine. My chosen party location was a community hall in #Chideock, a small village in West Dorset in southwest England, near to the coast but sufficiently inland and uphill that rising sea levels are unlikely to reach it.\n\nOn our journey we discussed cocktails, hot chocolate and the changes in fashion for altered states that can occur over a couple of centuries. The party will be on 6th June (and every year in between) but I controversially brought a Christmas song for the playlist (if mostly as a way to get to talk about #Longplayer). There's also a little discussion of meaning, purpose, #solarpunk and existential hope in there... just as there would be if Mike and I were cutting fresh limes at the bar.\n\nYou can find the full podcast episode here:\nhttps://2269.co/podcast/no-expectations-only-hopes-guest-chris-daniel-travels-to-the-greatest-party-of-all-time/\n\nTopics discussed in the podcast include: long-term thinking; The Long Now Foundation existential hope; being good ancestors; seventh generation thinking; futures literacy; story telling;","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1468,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"16:49:30","Channel Name":"📖books","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12275483-the-climbing-wave","User Message":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12275483-the-climbing-wave","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1469,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"17:02:12","Channel Name":"🔋collapse-tech-solarpunk","User":"dens","Link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VfBvdzgQxY&ab_channel=travelinglight56","User Message":"Re: guerrilla gardening, etc, recently found this video of the mother of all guerrilla gardens in NYC circa 1970s (which, of course, was torn down by the city) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VfBvdzgQxY&ab_channel=travelinglight56","Link Type":"Social Media"},{"row_id":1470,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"17:05:51","Channel Name":"🔋collapse-tech-solarpunk","User":"dens","Link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g2CaF12xxw&ab_channel=Vox","User Message":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g2CaF12xxw&ab_channel=Vox","Link Type":"Social Media"},{"row_id":1471,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"17:48:19","Channel Name":"🔋collapse-tech-solarpunk","User":"dens","Link":"https://www.ted.com/talks/natalie_jeremijenko_the_art_of_the_eco_mindshift/transcript?language=en","User Message":"https://www.ted.com/talks/natalie_jeremijenko_the_art_of_the_eco_mindshift/transcript?language=en","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1472,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"20:23:21","Channel Name":"📱humane-technology","User":"WrexVerdi","Link":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/stranded-dog-saved-from-drowning-after-rescuers-attach-sausage-to-drone","User Message":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/stranded-dog-saved-from-drowning-after-rescuers-attach-sausage-to-drone","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1473,"Date":"01/20/2022","Time":"21:23:47","Channel Name":"📎design-fiction","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://lifeathome.ikea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IKEA_LifeatHome_Magazine2021.pdf","User Message":"Hello!

History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.\n\n— G.W.F. Hegel, Philosophy of Right (1820), \"Preface\"; translated by S W Dyde, 1896”\n\nBasically any attempt to speculate beyond ones time and place is nonsensical and only ends in error for projecting the present forever into the future rather than outlining conditions of the possible future based in the emerging present.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/sjwsi4/why_philosophers_seem_to_dislike_women_or_never/hvhwqcq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1686,"Date":"02/04/2022","Time":"15:18:59","Channel Name":"🥼science-fiction","User":"pegaunisusicornslimebreaker","Link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/sjwsi4/comment/hvhwqcq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3","User Message":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/sjwsi4/comment/hvhwqcq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1687,"Date":"02/04/2022","Time":"15:36:55","Channel Name":"🚦signals-and-inspirations","User":"WrexVerdi","Link":"http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/materials/2dpa-1-polymer-10518.html","User Message":"http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/materials/2dpa-1-polymer-10518.html","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1688,"Date":"02/04/2022","Time":"15:54:54","Channel Name":"🚦signals-and-inspirations","User":"pegaunisusicornslimebreaker","Link":"https://hub.jhu.edu/2022/02/01/food-of-the-future-intersession","User Message":"Design Fiction Fungus Foods have already arrived!: \n\nhttps://hub.jhu.edu/2022/02/01/food-of-the-future-intersession","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1689,"Date":"02/04/2022","Time":"16:43:58","Channel Name":"🔋solarpunk-collapse-tech","User":"zazou","Link":"https://www.npr.org/2022/02/03/1077392791/a-satellite-finds-massive-methane-leaks-from-gas-pipelines","User Message":"Most the personal behaviour and consumerist actions will do nothing about this:\nhttps://www.npr.org/2022/02/03/1077392791/a-satellite-finds-massive-methane-leaks-from-gas-pipelines","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1690,"Date":"02/04/2022","Time":"16:49:13","Channel Name":"🔋solarpunk-collapse-tech","User":"zazou","Link":"https://www.wired.com/story/big-ag-is-sabotaging-progress-on-climate-change","User Message":"A key driver of the biosphere and climate collapses is industrialized agriculture.

Worth a read, but not much new. Concedes to IPFS as \"interesting\" with some caveats. I wish it wasn't so rant-y and breathless. One quibble would be the argument that the technology to bring about a decentralized network already exists so blockchain is nothing new, and also a scam. But, the linkage between something already existing and something \"taking hold\" (which is..what? mass adoption? economic success? more articles about it on Medium or the NY Times?) is quite beside the point and a bit of a distraction. PGP is mentioned as a way of securing the authenticity of something, like an email or a blog post but, I mean..I'm an astute, technically adept engineer and I recall trying to integrate it into my email workflow and, like..what a shitshow. The point being that, as I'm sure everyone here will appreciate, just cause there's a wrench in the garage doesn't mean you're going to fix the leaky faucet.

An isophor is then something that is \"experienced emotionally and, (that) as such, define(s) the experience of understanding.\" (Isophor: poiesis of experience, 1987 ). Elsewhere Forsythe (Cathedrals of the Mind, 1986) argues that: \"Analogy and its poetic expression, metaphor, may be the \"meta-forms\" necessary to understanding those aspects of our mind that make connections, often in non-verbal and implicit fashion, that allow us to understand the world in a whole way.\" With the isophor there is no separation between thought and action, between feeling and experience. The experience itself is evoked through the relation. She suggests that the experience of one thing in terms of another, the isophor, is the means by which domain is mapped to domain and that consciousness of this meta-action, when recognized, lies at the heart of cognition. Forsythe has postulated the development of an epistemology of newness in which learning is the perception of newness and cognition depends on a disposition for wonder leading to this domain of conception-perception interactions. She argues that the notion of metaphor is commonly understood to mean the description of one thing in terms of another -- presupposing an objective reality. This objectivity may be questioned especially if, as suggested by Maturana, (objectivity) is placed in parentheses.\nhttps://laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/corresp.php","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1928,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:38:52","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"dens","Link":"https://www.thejaymo.net/2021/08/18/solarpunk-a-narrative-strategy-the-stoa/","User Message":"This is the Jaymo talk:  https://www.thejaymo.net/2021/08/18/solarpunk-a-narrative-strategy-the-stoa/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1929,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:39:12","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"Patrick Tanguay","Link":"https://www.paulfletcherhill.com/solarpunk","User Message":"https://www.paulfletcherhill.com/solarpunk","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1930,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:41:18","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"dens","Link":"https://therevelator.org/divestment-big-month/","User Message":"https://therevelator.org/divestment-big-month/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1931,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:47:23","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"ADH","Link":"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ursula-k-le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction","User Message":"re stories without hero's journey, i always come back to Le Guin: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ursula-k-le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1932,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:52:14","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"mushon","Link":"https://18.re-publica.com/en/session/solarpunk-going-post-post-apocalyptic","User Message":"<@!619058383680569365> @ Republica panel https://18.re-publica.com/en/session/solarpunk-going-post-post-apocalyptic","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1933,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:52:15","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"ADH","Link":"https://www.worldweaverpress.com/store/p169/Glass_and_Gardens%3A_Solarpunk_Winters.html","User Message":"a few links I dropped in the <#895693903611699231> channel during our discussion.\nre: what does solarpunk look like in February https://www.worldweaverpress.com/store/p169/Glass_and_Gardens%3A_Solarpunk_Winters.html\nanother solarpunk + snow story, with some stuff to say about \"efficiency\" as well, by cli-fi master Paolo Bacigalup: https://csi.asu.edu/story/chicago/#efficiency","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1934,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:53:29","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"mushon","Link":"https://youtu.be/wbY65fyTWn8","User Message":"direct link to the video (disclaimer, I'm also there...): https://youtu.be/wbY65fyTWn8","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1935,"Date":"02/16/2022","Time":"19:54:04","Channel Name":"general-seminar-17","User":"ADH","Link":"https://csi.asu.edu/story/portland/#solarshades","User Message":"re: the graffiti prompt discussion around who the reactionary discontents might be in a solarpunk/ecotopian future.

The euthanasia coaster has no narrative beyond what you bring or apply to it, but I don’t think this lack of narrative a requirement. For my money, the point of design fiction is focused on exploring the novum more than a particular narrative around the novum. What are its consequences? What are its causes? What kind of society would need to produce it and why? Who would use it and how? What would change? What would lead there and do we want to do that? Contrast Star Wars, which isn’t about the social implications of lightsabers as much as it is space opera about dynasties, light fascism, and the magic of friendship.\n\nhttps://scifiinterfaces.com/2022/02/17/design-fiction-in-sci-fi/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1968,"Date":"02/18/2022","Time":"13:31:48","Channel Name":"🌕crypto","User":"zazou","Link":"https://news.bitcoin.com/canadian-police-freeze-crypto-wallets-tied-to-freedom-convoy-protests-vow-to-take-back-ottawa-in-entirety/","User Message":"Seems like an obvious case that DLC's are mostly smoke and mirrors\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/canadian-police-freeze-crypto-wallets-tied-to-freedom-convoy-protests-vow-to-take-back-ottawa-in-entirety/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1969,"Date":"02/18/2022","Time":"14:57:35","Channel Name":"🚀retro-futures","User":"Patrick Tanguay","Link":"https://70sscifiart.tumblr.com","User Message":"LOADS of nice retro scifi (and memories) on here: https://70sscifiart.tumblr.com","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1970,"Date":"02/18/2022","Time":"15:07:47","Channel Name":"🧢generalists-club","User":"Patrick Tanguay","Link":"https://sentiers.media/conscientious-urban-tech/","User Message":"Published this interview with <@!829162832968024084> yesterday, some bits about generalists and futures in there. https://sentiers.media/conscientious-urban-tech/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1971,"Date":"02/18/2022","Time":"15:13:26","Channel Name":"🔋solarpunk-collapse-tech","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://newatlas.com/altaeros-floating-wind-turbine/31525/","User Message":"https://newatlas.com/altaeros-floating-wind-turbine/31525/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":1972,"Date":"02/18/2022","Time":"15:24:48","Channel Name":"📣introduce-yourself","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://calendly.com/julian-bleecker/stand-up-coffee-chat","User Message":"<@!252508743093321729> Welcome Coralie!

You can read the conversation leading to the proposal here in this (archived) thread: https://discord.com/channels/724979694667169862/946269780086767616\n\nIt was all quite last minute (from roughly when I decided to work on it until when it was due was maybe 2 or 3 days, if that..and they weren't totally free days) and as much an effort to think about how we talk about what's going on in this community as it was a pitch to get the grant and have some additional facility through which to do what I and others want to do. The best part of the going through proposal writing headaches was that while I was working on this with <@!758825074031067138> I was kinda struggling with their emphasis on \"public engagement\" until it occurred to me that a place like LACMA would be a great opportunity to have public workshops, lectures, General Seminar-type sessions to discuss and engage in futuring, which is to say what Ed Finn mentioned in Podcast Episode 26 which was \".. inspiring collective imagination for better futures. We're trying to work on getting people, trying to change our whole relationship to the future and get people to feel a sense of agency and responsibility.\"\n\nSo that's more or less what I was trying to say in those two sentences. \"Teaching\" or workshopping Design Fiction with a public that is inclined to learn and experience and evolve their ways of understanding and seeing the world..LACMA could be a great platform for working on building up our imagination muscles.","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2112,"Date":"02/27/2022","Time":"20:51:16","Channel Name":"🥼science-fiction","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://eventbrite.com/e/dangerous-visions-and-new-worlds-session-eight-tickets-255699814027","User Message":"Upcoming event later today featuring Cory Doctorow and others on  a panel called \"False Dawns and Wandergrounds: Dystopia, Then and Now,\" as part of City Lights's launch of *Dangerous Visions and New Worlds: Radical Science Fiction, 1950 to 1985*:\n\nhttps://eventbrite.com/e/dangerous-visions-and-new-worlds-session-eight-tickets-255699814027\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Visions-New-Worlds-1950-1985/dp/1629638838/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2113,"Date":"02/27/2022","Time":"20:55:37","Channel Name":"🌕crypto","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P","User Message":"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2114,"Date":"02/27/2022","Time":"20:55:39","Channel Name":"🌕crypto","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://etherscan.io/address/0x165cd37b4c644c2921454429e7f9358d18a45e14","User Message":"https://etherscan.io/address/0x165cd37b4c644c2921454429e7f9358d18a45e14","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2115,"Date":"02/27/2022","Time":"20:56:30","Channel Name":"🌕crypto","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://decrypt.co/93568/vending-machine-new-york-city-selling-solana-nfts","User Message":"Hey, anyone in NYC see this anywhere? \n\nhttps://decrypt.co/93568/vending-machine-new-york-city-selling-solana-nfts\n\n(cc/ <@!697904263598178316> <@!757690566803849277> )","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2116,"Date":"02/28/2022","Time":"14:45:36","Channel Name":"🌕crypto","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://watcher.app/","User Message":"https://watcher.app/","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2117,"Date":"02/28/2022","Time":"14:46:14","Channel Name":"🌕crypto","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1599608893","User Message":"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1599608893","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2118,"Date":"02/28/2022","Time":"20:23:37","Channel Name":"🎤events","User":"HarrySilver","Link":"https://www.millennium-project.org/world-future-day-24-hour-round-the-world-conversion-on-the-future/","User Message":"Apparently, today is World Futures Day.  https://www.millennium-project.org/world-future-day-24-hour-round-the-world-conversion-on-the-future/\nSounds like an opportunity to bring some design fiction artefacts to the 24 hour conversation.\n“Anybody can pull up a cyber-chair at this global table and join the discussion on ZOOM at: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/5221011954?pwd=UEg4TXhYMnU0TGxyNzNsUUd6dXQ4Zz09","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2119,"Date":"03/01/2022","Time":"10:27:43","Channel Name":"notes-to-self","User":"WeatherXM #📢│announcements","Link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weatherxm.app","User Message":"**Android App Update** March 1st, 2022 - We released a new public version - `3.0.3-3f653e9`.

I had forgotten about the fun of WinAmp skins..\nTo the point of printing out photobooks, which has been a fair bit of a hobby of mine (although the last 12 months of not really having easy access to my studio has muted that a bit) I can offer no solace except an slightly unsatisfactory perspective which is that a decent photo printer and a study of simple book binding has been a great bit of craft work and makes the best gift.\nThe other is to say that many online print shops will do books. You don’t get a shit ton of customization as pertains material, paper, etc. It will require that you do layout work, which I personally consider as important as the actual photography - a photo book can be more than a crude album, of course. It should be telling a story.\nThe other thing to say is that Newspaper Club is a great facility for getting things printed.\n\nThe small book on the right is an example of a book I’ve made - a style of uber simple photo book where I print on a nice matte durable slightly heavier stock and use binder’s tape to hold it together. Very satisfying. The other book is the first printing of the same book in the video, done on a semi-gloss by an area print-on-demand guy called printivity (it’s like infinity on its printing. get it?) - just sharing as an example of what POD guys end up providing.\n\nhttps://www.printivity.com\n\nhttps://www.newspaperclub.com/\n\nThat video is an example of a project with Newspaper Club.\n\nI suppose if you’re trying to print out 700 photos maybe this is all underwhelming though..\n\nI will occasionally print out stacks and stacks of photos (700 is mental..) and just have them in a box. I have a couple of boxes of photos from my OMATA years..and I also have two 400 page volumes of more a photo book from those years - but I haven’t yet printed them because I’m not sure the story is over quite yet, but that may be more my internal psychic state than anything else!\n\nPhotobooks are a thing. As you’ve found, you may not find any satisfactory easy and plug ‘n play solution. Even when the stacks were open, I never found anything especially satisfying. The books I made back then - I’m glad I did (early days Thailand before it got fucked..5 days of gleeful misery on the Inca Trail..tramping cross country) but you can’t go off the rails with these things, which is why I suffer through InDesign to compose and go to photobook workshops and have a mad collection of photobooks!","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2195,"Date":"03/06/2022","Time":"15:43:41","Channel Name":"🛠utilities","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://bear.app/","User Message":"I’ve been using Bear for a few years.

I keep looking at the garden as a means to get the lenses out and interconnect them well.","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2199,"Date":"03/06/2022","Time":"18:24:54","Channel Name":"📝general","User":"vanderwal","Link":"https://pca.st/podcast/2c22bfa0-cecf-0130-37a2-723c91aeae46","User Message":"One related element I stumbled onto in recent months is Alexander Obenauer's Personal Operating System, which I found from the StackOverflow podcast with him - https://pca.st/podcast/2c22bfa0-cecf-0130-37a2-723c91aeae46","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2200,"Date":"03/06/2022","Time":"19:11:02","Channel Name":"📝general","User":"vanderwal","Link":"https://www.personalinfocloud.com/blog/2016/3/10/diversity-of-enterprise-social","User Message":"This is a quick overview of the Social Perspectives with: Collective, Cooperative (with its scales), and Collaborative along with the Communication layer which is the glue. https://www.personalinfocloud.com/blog/2016/3/10/diversity-of-enterprise-social","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2201,"Date":"03/06/2022","Time":"19:17:17","Channel Name":"📝general","User":"vanderwal","Link":"https://www.personalinfocloud.com/blog/2010/8/12/on-fire-with-social-progressions.html","User Message":"My common entry point is a complete metaphor of \"the social progression of fire\" moving from a spark of an idea, to a campfire where a collective digs deep, to a bonfire to share it widely and find gaps and needs to see if it can be made real and should be, and then to a torch where a small team makes it real by making it replicable, safe, and reliable. - https://www.personalinfocloud.com/blog/2010/8/12/on-fire-with-social-progressions.html\n\nFrom this metaphor I walk into the actual social perspectives, which somewhat map to the fire metaphor, but try to tease out where the gap, need, interest, and problems are.

For most people on our planet, speciesism is something completely normalized, justified, and encouraged through many facets of dominant cultures. The field of critical/political animal studies, and other fields that challenge anthropocentrism, have already thoroughly problematized, questioned, and analyzed speciesist practices, but one topic receives little academic attention: what can a counter-concept to speciesism contain, without saying what it is not?\n\nThis thesis is concerned with imagining ‘multispecies worldings’, with the goal to construct positive rather than negative aspects of a counter-concept to speciesism. Instead of offering a single answer, this work illustrates how additive knowledges regarding the possible meanings of ‘multispecies worlding’ make worlds richer. These knowledges emerge through a repertoire of world-making practices with other animals in which we recognize and engage with the ability to respond to each other.\n\n[...]\n\nhttp://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1435111&dswid=-5414","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2240,"Date":"03/11/2022","Time":"14:34:22","Channel Name":"📃articles-and-essays","User":"nrgiga","Link":"https://www.diid.it/diid/index.php/diid/issue/view/diid75/diid75","User Message":"#morethanhuman\n\n**Dispatches on Humanity from a Disabled Cyborg**\n\nThis essay engages with the more than human from the per-spective of the disabled cyborg in order to explore themes around human-machine relations and pluriversal design in the context of hundreds of years of dehumanization.

The University of Toronto professor Blake Richards argues that memory isn’t supposed to act like a video recorder, instead he compares it to a list of useful rules that help us make better decisions. He also points out that we have yet to find the limits of what the human brain can store, hence we already have the potential to remember everything. Still, the brain actually spends energy making us forget, so why does it do so if our brains aren’t running out of space? Richards argues that forgetting old information can make us more efficient, and keep us from generalizing too much from one piece of information. He says “brains probably have been shaped by evolution to only remember that stuff that is pertinent to our survival. So maybe not being able to remember how you know someone is a feature of our brains, not a bug.” Maybe it is not only memory that defines us as humans, potentially it is also the ability to forget?\"\n\nhttps://victoria-cleverby.medium.com/what-if-the-ability-to-forget-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-e21645e5d826","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2534,"Date":"04/08/2022","Time":"15:42:58","Channel Name":"🌐web3","User":"darthjulian","Link":"https://aca.st/f3bebe","User Message":"Listen to Ampl(ed) Reasons to Join a MetaLabel from Digitally Rare on the Acast app\n\nhttps://aca.st/f3bebe","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2535,"Date":"04/08/2022","Time":"16:27:37","Channel Name":"🪐metaverse-talk","User":"Mat.NYC","Link":"https://asmrsoundlands.com/","User Message":"Wondering if anyone has come across any sound focused \"metaverse\" experiences or sounds related digital experiences?

Sign up at https://generalseminar.com and come along while we figure it all out. I think it's a hint of what we might become in here in the near future, which is exciting.\n* The <#963630130805239858> is cooking right along. Mostly right now it's in a Notion document and of course in discussion in that particular channel. A real book! That we'll create and manufacture! Super exciting. Feel free to get involved. We need help!\n* I've created a few more rewards-bearing project channels, including my current obsession <#964378714374803476> (an art-making NFT toy) and <#964884589548023898> kicked off by <@730347203322708018> to create a simple human-readable generator for good-ole <#895334975715573810>. Our idea is to have a very simple human-readable interface to what bibliobot finds so we can create a newsletter and a \"show\" called <#964601356440731719> \n* Did I mention <#964601356440731719>? Yeah, I want to produce a tight little show that is about the things bibliobot found in here from the previous week. It'd be very Near Future Laboratory and potentially even zany and definitely entertaining. Want to help? There's the channel just up there.\n\n* Now, the favor! Please, if you haven't subscribed, rated, or reviewed the Near Future Laboratory Podcast please take a moment right now to do just that. \n\nIt's super simple to do, about has easy as coming into the Discord and luxuriating in all the awesome people and discussions and super fun links — and it _really_ helps me feel like I'm doing something of value with all the time I put into producing it. \n\nThink of doing a rating and review as doing a wee bit of service in support of this nozzle and this community and all the things. \n\nJust go here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/near-future-laboratory-podcast/id1546452193\n\nThere are only 14 review! Fourteen! What the heck?? And there are nearly 800 folks in here, some of whom may actually listen to the podcast? What the..?? 🤷🏽‍♂️\n\nPlease, please, please, rate and review the podcast _right_ _now_ so we can continue to grow this awesome conversation about futures design and become the funnest place to commune and discuss making more habitable near future worlds!","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2691,"Date":"04/17/2022","Time":"20:29:08","Channel Name":"📃articles-and-essays","User":"GianPabloVillamil","Link":"https://doctorow.medium.com/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs-b2e8d5cda826","User Message":"Great article by Cory Doctorow on the rise of counter-algorithmic tools to help gig workers get better conditions: https://doctorow.medium.com/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs-b2e8d5cda826","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2692,"Date":"04/17/2022","Time":"22:42:08","Channel Name":"🧪laboratory-backroom","User":"fabien","Link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKA0aQWaxqlp8uYzxdTqqbiQg1OJCwlUQphfhztowmo/edit?usp=sharing","User Message":"I keep a list of all the project pages here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKA0aQWaxqlp8uYzxdTqqbiQg1OJCwlUQphfhztowmo/edit?usp=sharing .

PLEASE keep it coming.\n\n1) THIS WEEK we need to settle on all the words. The goal is to have a list, A to Z, that are Solarpunk-centric. Some words on the list are more generic-environmental, and that's okay. The long list can act as a Glossary of Terms in the long run, but right now, the goal is to lock in all the words. I encourage going nuts and adding as much as possible.\n\nNEXT WEEK\n\n2) Once we nail all the words, we will move on to crafting definitions for each one. This is where we can figure out a consistent tone of voice.\n\n3) Illustrator search: At the bottom of the doc are some illustrators I reached out to. They are all familiar with Solarpunk, and I think that should approach friendlies first as it'll be easier for them to get ramped up.","Link Type":"None"},{"row_id":2706,"Date":"04/18/2022","Time":"17:20:22","Channel Name":"🍎a-b-c-solarpunk-book","User":"Gabriel Shalom","Link":"https://www.blurb.com/","User Message":"<@453000604114223105> <@724979004137799690> you can make affordable book samples on https://www.blurb.com/","Link Type":"None"}]}
